# goshawk

An opinionated, configurable RTS (real-time-strategy) camera for [bevy](https://bevy.rs). It is somewhat inspired by the
Rome: Total War camera.

## Example

To run the example, run `cargo run --example basic --features "bevy/default" --release`. It may also be run in debug mode,
but that will run slower. You can use the mouse to pan by moving it to the edges of the screen, or you can use 
WASD/arrow keys with the keyboard. To zoom in, use the scroll wheel, or the plus and minus buttons on the keyboard. To
turn the camera, press Q and E, or move the mouse to the top left and right corners of the screen. To exit,
press escape. Be aware that this example starts in fullscreen borderless window mode.
