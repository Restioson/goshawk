# bevy_rts_camera

A highly configurable RTS camera for [bevy](https://bevy.rs). 

## Example

To run the example, run `cargo run --example basic --features "bevy/default" --release`. It may also be run in debug mode,
but that will run slower. You can use the mouse to pan by moving it to the edges of the screen, or you can use 
WASD/arrow keys with the keyboard. To zoom in, use the scroll wheel, or the plus and minus buttons on the keyboard.
